# Logistic Regression

In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. This can be extended to model several classes of events such as determining whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc. Each object being detected in the image would be assigned a probability between 0 and 1 and the sum adding to one.

Here we will use to classify a simple dataset which was created using the `sklearn.dataset` function.

The picture above shows the two classes of the data which we will try to predict.
