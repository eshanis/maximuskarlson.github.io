# 1. Abstract

The used dataset contains information about people and is mainly used for KNN. We will instead use a `decision tree` and and a `random forrest classifier` to distinguish between peeople who earn more or less than 50k per year. Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0))

An individual’s annual income results from various factors. Intuitively, it is influenced by the individual’s education level, age, gender, occupation, and etc.

**Fields:**  
The dataset contains 16 columns

* Target filed: Income
    The income is divide into two classes: 50K
* Number of attributes: 14
    These are the demographics and other features to describe a person

The dataset can be found either on the UCI Machine Learning repository [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) or on Kaggle [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset).

In this articel we will also do some data exploration but this will not be the focus. The main goal is to understand how we can use an `random forrest classifier` and how it works.

# 2. Decision Tree

Firstly we will take time to deeply understand why `decision trees` and `random forrest` do what they do and how we can tune them. As both of them have been explained on 28383 websites and books before I will just quote the explanation I thinks is the most understanable. To see the full version of it visit the following *towardsdatascience* [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2). Thanks to Tony Yiu for this awesome explanation.

Let’s quickly go over decision trees as they are the building blocks of the random forest model. Fortunately, they are pretty intuitive. I’d be willing to bet that most people have used a decision tree, knowingly or not, at some point in their lives.

**Simple Decision Tree Example**

It’s probably much easier to understand how a decision tree works through an example.
Imagine that our dataset consists of the numbers at the top of the figure to the left. We have two 1s and five 0s (1s and 0s are our classes) and desire to separate the classes using their features. The features are color (red vs. blue) and whether the observation is underlined or not. So how can we do this?

![Decision Tree Sructure](/images/dt-rf/dt1.jpeg)

Color seems like a pretty obvious feature to split by as all but one of the 0s are blue. So we can use the question, “Is it red?” to split our first node. You can think of a node in a tree as the point where the path splits into two — observations that meet the criteria go down the Yes branch and ones that don’t go down the No branch.
The No branch (the blues) is all 0s now so we are done there, but our Yes branch can still be split further. Now we can use the second feature and ask, “Is it underlined?” to make a second split.

The two 1s that are underlined go down the Yes subbranch and the 0 that is not underlined goes down the right subbranch and we are all done. Our decision tree was able to use the two features to split up the data perfectly. Victory!
Obviously in real life our data will not be this clean but the logic that a decision tree employs remains the same. At each node, it will ask —

>What feature will allow me to split the observations at hand in a way that the resulting groups are as different from each other as possible (and the members of each resulting subgroup are as similar to each other as possible)?

# 3. Random Forrest

Random forest, like its name implies, consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an [ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning). Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our model’s prediction (see figure below).

![Visualization of a Random Forest Model Making a Prediction](/images/dt-rf/rf1.jpeg)

**Visualization of a Random Forest Model Making a Prediction**

The fundamental concept behind random forest is a simple but powerful one — the wisdom of crowds. In data science speak, the reason that the random forest model works so well is:

>A large number of relatively uncorrelated models (trees) operating as a committee will outperform any of the individual constituent models.

The low correlation between models is the key. Just like how investments with low correlations (like stocks and bonds) come together to form a portfolio that is greater than the sum of its parts, uncorrelated models can produce ensemble predictions that are more accurate than any of the individual predictions. **The reason for this wonderful effect is that the trees protect each other from their individual errors (as long as they don’t constantly all err in the same direction)**. While some trees may be wrong, many other trees will be right, so as a group the trees are able to move in the correct direction. So the prerequisites for random forest to perform well are:

* There needs to be some actual signal in our features so that models built using those features do better than random guessing.
* The predictions (and therefore the errors) made by the individual trees need to have low correlations with each other.

**Ensuring that the Models Diversify Each Other:**

So how does random forest ensure that the behavior of each individual tree is not too correlated with the behavior of any of the other trees in the model? It uses the following two methods:
Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation) — Decisions trees are very sensitive to the data they are trained on — small changes to the training set can result in significantly different tree structures. Random forest takes advantage of this by allowing each individual tree to randomly sample from the dataset with replacement, resulting in different trees. This process is known as bagging.

Notice that with bagging we are not subsetting the training data into smaller chunks and training each tree on a different chunk. Rather, if we have a sample of size N, we are still feeding each tree a training set of size N (unless specified otherwise). But instead of the original training data, we take a random sample of size N with replacement. For example, if our training data was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] then we might give one of our trees the following list [1, 2, 2, 3, 6, 6]. Notice that both lists are of length six and that “2” and “6” are both repeated in the randomly selected training data we give to our tree (because we sample with replacement).

![Node splitting in a random forest model is based on a random subset of features for each tree.](/images/dt-rf/bagging.jpeg)

**Feature Randomness** — In a normal decision tree, when it is time to split a node, we consider every possible feature and pick the one that produces the most separation between the observations in the left node vs. those in the right node. In contrast, each tree in a random forest can pick only from a random subset of features. This forces even more variation amongst the trees in the model and ultimately results in lower correlation across trees and more diversification.
Let’s go through a visual example — in the picture above, the traditional decision tree (in blue) can select from all four features when deciding how to split the node. It decides to go with Feature 1 (black and underlined) as it splits the data into groups that are as separated as possible.

Now let’s take a look at our random forest. We will just examine two of the forest’s trees in this example. When we check out random forest Tree 1, we find that it it can only consider Features 2 and 3 (selected randomly) for its node splitting decision. We know from our traditional decision tree (in blue) that Feature 1 is the best feature for splitting, but Tree 1 cannot see Feature 1 so it is forced to go with Feature 2 (black and underlined). Tree 2, on the other hand, can only see Features 1 and 3 so it is able to pick Feature 1.

>So in our random forest, we end up with trees that are not only trained on different sets of data (thanks to bagging) but also use different features to make decisions.

And that, my dear reader, creates uncorrelated trees that buffer and protect each other from their errors.

# 4. Create some Cooooooode

## 4.1. Visualizations

As described we will investigate the `adult` datasetz which contains information about peoles salary and personal details like education, race etc.

As this is no coding tutorial I will skip a detailed code explanaition. Just in short: I love `plotly.express` !! Thankt to this awesome library all of the displayed graphs are interactivea and you can therefor investigate the data on your own!

```python
# imports in any kind and shape

import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.offline as off
import seaborn as sns

cols = ['workclass', 'fnlwgt', 'edu', 'edu-num', 'mariage_status',
          'occupation', 'relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'cap_gain',
           'cap_loss', 'h_per_week', 'native_country', 'salary']
data = pd.read_csv('adult.data', header=None, index_col=0, names=cols)
test = pd.read_csv('adult.test', header=None, index_col=0, names=cols)
```

The overall goal is to extract a reason for different salaries - as the most obvious (and falsy believed reason) is that working hours are the main reason for a big payday we will investigate this first: 

<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plot.ly/~maximuskarlson/1.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>

As wen can see there seems to a small trend that men tend to work a little bit longer than women, and the 50% quartile of the *white americans* seems to be a bit higher  than the 50% quartile of every other race.

Furthermore we want to inspect we want to checkout if the `education` directly correlates with `gained capital` which could be achieved during the year. 

<iframe width="900" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~maximuskarlson/4.embed"></iframe>

Even not really strong (and less than expected) there seems to be an increase in gained captial with higher education.

## 4.2. Preprocessing

To be able to achieve great results we need to preprocess the data. We will use the `sklearn LabelEncoder` to transfer categorical data into labeled data.

```python
to_be_labeled = ['workclass', 'edu', 'mariage_status', 'occupation',
       'relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'native_country', 'salary']

from sklearn import preprocessing
le = preprocessing.LabelEncoder()
for col in to_be_labeled:
    data[col] = le.fit_transform(data[col])
    test[col] = le.fit_transform(test[col])
```

After that, every of our columns only contains integers and we can easily use this data for our classification.
We now only need to split into test and train and call the corresponding `DecisionTree classifier`.

```python
X_train = data.drop('salary', axis=1)
y_train = data['salary']

X_test = test.drop('salary', axis=1)
y_test = test['salary']

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=7)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(clf.feature_importances_)

#################
[0.00208582 0.00171024 0.03111613 0.18159366 0.17989353 0.01938149
 0.24270104 0.00072985 0.0264397  0.2126658  0.04426182 0.05653833

```

The best thing (as mentioned before) when using decison  trees or random forrests is the clear understanding why the tree classified everything as he did. The simple function `feature_importances` gives us the corresponding importance to each of our input-features.

<iframe width="900" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~maximuskarlson/6.embed"></iframe>

We can clearly see that `relationship, cap_gain, edu-num & mariage_status` are way more important that all the other features.

So but what happens now if use our just build tree to predict unseen data? Let's check it out:

```python
preds = clf.predict(X_test)
print('Accruracy score: {}'.format(accuracy_score(y_test, preds)))
```

**Accruracy score: 0.8497021067501996** --> not too bad huh? But lets try to improve that!

## 4.3. Random forrest

Let's first get the parameters which were currently used to create the decision tree:

```python
from pprint import pprint
print('Parameters currently in use:\n')
pprint(clf.get_params())

###########
{'bootstrap': True,
 'ccp_alpha': 0.0,
 'class_weight': None,
 'criterion': 'gini',
 'max_depth': 5,
 'max_features': 'auto',
 'max_leaf_nodes': None,
 'max_samples': None,
 'min_impurity_decrease': 0.0,
 'min_impurity_split': None,
 'min_samples_leaf': 1,
 'min_samples_split': 2,
 'min_weight_fraction_leaf': 0.0,
 'n_estimators': 100,
 'n_jobs': None,
 'oob_score': False,
 'random_state': 7,
 'verbose': 0,
 'warm_start': False}
 ############
```

Wow, that is quite an overwhelming list! How do we know where to start? A good place is the documentation on the random forest in Scikit-Learn. This tells us the most important settings are the number of trees in the forest (n_estimators) and the number of features considered for splitting at each leaf node (max_features). We could go read the research papers on the random forest and try to theorize the best hyperparameters, but a more efficient use of our time is just to try out a wide range of values and see what works! We will try adjusting the following set of hyperparameters:

* n_estimators = number of trees in the foreset
* max_features = max number of features considered for splitting a node
* max_depth = max number of levels in each decision tree
* min_samples_split = min number of data points placed in a node before the node is split
* min_samples_leaf = min number of data points allowed in a leaf node
* bootstrap = method for sampling data points (with or without replacement)

## 4.4. Grid Search

Now we have a good starting point to create our GridSearch-Parameter-Set:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV

# Number of trees in random forest
n_estimators = [int(x) for x in np.linspace(start = 200, stop = 2000, num = 10)]
# Number of features to consider at every split
max_features = ['auto', 'sqrt']
# Maximum number of levels in tree
max_depth = [int(x) for x in np.linspace(5, 110, num = 11)]
max_depth.append(None)
# Minimum number of samples required to split a node
min_samples_split = [2, 5, 10]
# Minimum number of samples required at each leaf node
min_samples_leaf = [1, 2, 4]
# Method of selecting samples for training each tree
bootstrap = [True, False]
# Create the random grid
random_grid = {'n_estimators': n_estimators,
               'max_features': max_features,
               'max_depth': max_depth,
               'min_samples_split': min_samples_split,
               'min_samples_leaf': min_samples_leaf,
               'bootstrap': bootstrap}
pprint(random_grid)

###########
{'bootstrap': [True, False],
 'max_depth': [5, 15, 26, 36, 47, 57, 68, 78, 89, 99, 110, None],
 'max_features': ['auto', 'sqrt'],
 'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4],
 'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
 'n_estimators': [200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000]}
###########
```
The most important arguments in RandomizedSearchCV are n_iter, which controls the number of different combinations to try, and cv which is the number of folds to use for cross validation (we use 100 and 3 respectively). More iterations will cover a wider search space and more cv folds reduces the chances of overfitting, but raising each will increase the run time. Machine learning is a field of trade-offs, and performance vs time is one of the most fundamental.  
Now we fit the random forest classifier and print out the best parameters:

```python
# Use the random grid to search for best hyperparameters
# First create the base model to tune
rf = RandomForestClassifier()
# Random search of parameters, using 3 fold cross validation, 
# search across 100 different combinations, and use all available cores
rf_random = RandomizedSearchCV(estimator = rf, param_distributions = random_grid,
                               n_iter = 100, cv = 3, verbose=2, random_state=7, n_jobs = -1)
# Fit the random search model
rf_random.fit(X_train, y_train)

print('Best params: {}'.format(rf_random.best_params_))

#############
Best params: {'n_estimators': 1200, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'max_depth': 15, 'bootstrap': True}
#############
```

## 4.5. Evaluate or optimizations

Let's evaluate what we just did against avery basic model:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def evaluate(model, test_features, test_labels):
    predictions = model.predict(test_features)
    acc = accuracy_score(test_labels, predictions)
    print('Model Performance')
    print('Accuracy = {}%.'.format(acc))
    return(acc)

base_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators = 10, random_state = 7)
base_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
base_accuracy = evaluate(base_model, X_test, y_test)

best_random = rf_random.best_estimator_
random_accuracy = evaluate(best_random, X_test, y_test)

print('Improvement of {:0.2f}%.'.format( 100 * (random_accuracy - base_accuracy) / base_accuracy))
```

**Model Performanc**   
**Accuracy = 0.8608807812787912%.**  
**Improvement of 2.35%.**  

We achieved an unspectacular improvement in accuracy of 2.35%. Depending on the application though, this could be a significant benefit. We can further improve our results by using grid search to focus on the most promising hyperparameters ranges found in the random search.

I hope this tutorial was helpful, thanks for reading!
