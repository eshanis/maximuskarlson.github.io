# Scope

>This project includes both signal processing methods and various machine learning techniques such as clustering & support vector machines. Due to the size of the project, not every method used can be explained in detail. I am also in no way a specialist in signal processing methods, so the results obtained here should only be considered as a first suggestion and certainly provide room for optimization!  
Furthermore, various publications form the basis of this work and offer further information on the respective topics.
